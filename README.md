Was supposed to help you protect your server, centered around moderation, would check if a grabify was posted, etc. This will be licensed under Mozilla Public License 2.0. Basically what that means is that if you use my code, yours must be open source. Failure to comply.... we can talk :). Reach out to me at Vintheruler#0 on Discord. (The username is Vintheruler1)
